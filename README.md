1. Name: Hugo Portillo and Email: hjportillo@my.waketech.edu
2. I created my Github account two days ago and my username is hjportillo-ux.
3. The repository is in my files now. It has the name of hjportillo-ux.github.io.
4. I created my repository on github. However, I had hard time cloning the repository to my machine. I had added an extra period to the name of repository. Finally, after fixing this mistake, I was able to clone my repository by going to file, clone repository, selecting my repository and finally selecting where I wanted to clone my repository.
